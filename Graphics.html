Evaluation of web graphics
</h2>
<hr/>
	<h4>History</h4>
	<a href="https://www.history.com/">www.History.com</a>
	<ul>
	<li>
	<p>A: I feel that the use of graphics are used in a way to illistrate what each article is going to be about. Not only that but with the use of pictures can draw in people with interesting pictures instead of big titles and/or text. Some say that a picture can speak a thousand words, in turn a picturte might be more impactful compared to a written long drawn out title. The purpose of this website is to one, keep the attention of the viewer and two, to help create a visual structure for information. </p>
	</li>
		<li> 
		<p> B: When looking at the guidelines for effective use of web graphics, I noticed that the page followed many of the rules listed. For example, they porvided textual equivalent alternatives for the graphics, they would have a title below each graphic to denote what it was. Also, the graphics on the page were used to help highlight the important peices on the page.</p>
		</li>

<h2 id="filetypes">Graphic File Types</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Image 1: The file format that would be most appropriate for putting this image on the web page would have to be a JPEG.This method would be used since it is a lossy compression meaning that it owuld remove all of the unneeded extra bits leaving behind the same image look just with a smaller file size, while retaining all of the data necessary.</p>
	</li>
		<li>
			<p>Image 2: As for this image, the best method would also have to be a JPEG. Since this is a sitll photo graph of an animal it does not require a losseless compression since that would take up uneeded extra space just for a few more pixel elements.</p>
		</li>
			<li>
				<p>Image 3: Now for this image, this would be best if the method of a PNG was used in order to put the image itself on the webpage. Since the graphic is color heavy and with the photo being complex; it does require a losseless compression so that it can preserve the original file with all of its bits to really so off the complexity of the desgin. </p>
			</li>
				<li> 
					<p>Image 4: The best method to implement for putting this image on a web page would have to be either a GIF or a JPEG since the item is a still image and is fairly simple in design, as well as color. Not only that but GIG are used when grapfics have flat colors and no gradients attached to the particualr item.</p>
				</li>
	<li>
			<p>Image 5: For the simple image of the red and white octagon stop sign, the best method here to use would have to be a JPEG due to the fact that it is a simple image with fairly basic colors. Not only that but the image does not need to retain all of the bits inorder to show the same image, it can still represent the stop sign in a lower quality. In fact the use of a lower quality image will save space and do the same job as another peice of clipart with more bits. </p>
