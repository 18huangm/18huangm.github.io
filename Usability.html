<h1>Usability Study</h1>
	<h2>Method:</h2>
		<p>The website I was assigned to study was art.yale.edu. the target audience would be art students at Yale. The tree tasks that i was assinged to do were 1. find the summer programs, 2. find a discription of the summer program , 3. find how to apply for said programs.  </p>
	<h2>Results:</h2>
		<p>I was not able to complet the three tasks that were assigned. Igt was not easy since the website was not very good to navigate around. It took a lot of time to complete the tasks that I did manage to accomplish and even with that it was completely trial and error on finding that information. In turn this caused me to take many steps.</p>
	<h2>Discussion:</h2>
		<p>I learned that this website is not very good to use at all. The current design is not very effective since it is hard to find anything on the site and the links take you to useless info. the site can be reorganize so that the links are more useful and take you to the needed data that you are looking for.</p>
